I just finished my Junior year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy, minoring in Physics. My interests lie in the application of Computer Science to solve a variety of problems. Currently my main research projects are focused on the intersection of machine learning/reinforcement learning, quantum computing/quantum machine learning, and simulations. My philosophical work is largely in continental philosophy, with a focus on maintaining my ivory tower. See my publications page for the results of some of these projects. 

This website is currently in its infancy, and will grow with time.
